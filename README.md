# GINFINITY ðŸš€ : Graph-based RNA Structure Embedding Generator

## Introduction
GINFINITY is a Python package designed to generate embeddings from RNA secondary structures using a Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN). This project converts RNA secondary structures from dot-bracket notation into graph representations, which are then processed by a GIN model to obtain meaningful embeddings. These embeddings can be used for downstream tasks such as clustering, classification, or other forms of analysis.

## Repository Structure
The repository contains the following key components:

- **`src/ginfinity/`**: The main package directory.
  - **`model/gin_model.py`**: GIN model implementation.
  - **`utils.py`**: Utility functions for RNA graph processing and general helpers.
  - **`scripts/`**: Directory containing operational scripts installable as command-line tools.
    - **`generate_embeddings.py`** (command: `ginfinity-embed`)
    - **`compute_distances.py`** (command: `ginfinity-compute-distances`)
    - **`generate_windows.py`** (command: `ginfinity-generate-windows`)
    - **`train_model.py`** (command: `ginfinity-train`)
    - **`scripts_README.md`**: Detailed documentation for all scripts in this directory.
  - **`training/`**: Modules related to model training, like custom datasets and loss functions.
  - **`weights/`**: Location for pre-trained model weights (included in the package).

## Installation

GINFINITY is packaged using modern Python standards and can be installed directly from its Git repository.

### Prerequisites
- Conda (recommended for environment management)
- Python 3.10 (the environment will be set up with this version)
- `pip` and `git` installed on your system.

### Step 1: Set Up Conda Environment

1.  Create a new conda environment named `ginfinity-env` with Python 3.10:
    ```sh
    conda create -n ginfinity-env python=3.10
    ```
2.  Activate the newly created environment:
    ```sh
    conda activate ginfinity-env
    ```

### Step 2: Install GINFINITY Package

With the `ginfinity-env` activated, install the GINFINITY package from GitHub.

To install the latest version from the `main` branch:
```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/nicoaira/GINFINITY.git#egg=ginfinity
```
To install a specific version (e.g., v2.0.1):
```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/nicoaira/GINFINITY.git@v0.2.1#egg=ginfinity
```
This command will automatically handle the core dependencies listed in `pyproject.toml`.

GINFINITY requires PyTorch Geometric extensions that are hardware-specific. You must install GINFINITY with the appropriate PyTorch Geometric wheel index based on your system configuration.

#### Check Your CUDA Version

First, determine which CUDA version you have (if any):

```sh
# Check if CUDA is available
nvidia-smi

# Or check CUDA version specifically
nvcc --version
```

#### Choose Your Installation Command

Note that you can install any version older than your CUDA driver. For example, if you have CUDA 12.5, you can install the version for CUDA 12.4 but not for CUDA 12.6

- **For CUDA 12.6 systems (latest):**
```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/nicoaira/GINFINITY.git#egg=ginfinity -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.6.0+cu126.html
```

- **For CUDA 12.4 systems:**
```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/nicoaira/GINFINITY.git#egg=ginfinity -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.6.0+cu124.html
```

- **For CUDA 11.8 systems (legacy clusters):**
```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/nicoaira/GINFINITY.git#egg=ginfinity -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.6.0+cu118.html
```

**For CPU-only systems (no GPU):**
```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/nicoaira/GINFINITY.git#egg=ginfinity -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.6.0+cpu.html
```

- **To install a specific version (e.g., v2.0.1) with CUDA 12.8:**
```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/nicoaira/GINFINITY.git@v2.0.1#egg=ginfinity -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.6.0+cu128.html
```

> **Important**: The `-f` flag specifies the PyTorch Geometric wheel index that matches your CUDA version. This ensures that the PyTorch Geometric extensions (torch-scatter, torch-sparse, torch-cluster, torch-spline-conv) are compiled for your specific CUDA version.

#### Verify CUDA Compatibility

After installation, you can verify that PyTorch detects your GPU correctly:

```python
import torch
print(f"CUDA available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}")
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    print(f"CUDA version: {torch.version.cuda}")
    print(f"GPU count: {torch.cuda.device_count()}")
    print(f"GPU name: {torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)}")
```

### Step 3: (Optional) Install Dependencies for Training
If you intend to train new models, you'll need additional dependencies. You can install them using:
```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/nicoaira/GINFINITY.git#egg=ginfinity[train] -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.7.0+cu128.html
```

(Replace the wheel index URL with the appropriate one for your CUDA version from the options above)

### Step 4: Verify Installation
Pre-trained model weights are included within the package in the `src/ginfinity/weights` directory and should be accessible after installation. 

To quickly verify that the GINFINITY command-line tools are available, you can try:
```sh
ginfinity-embed --help
```
This should display the help message for the `generate_embeddings.py` script.

(The previous instruction to download `GIN-Secondary.pth` might be outdated if weights are now packaged. Please verify and update this section if necessary based on your `MANIFEST.in` and `pyproject.toml` setup for including weights.)

## Usage
GINFINITY provides a suite of command-line tools to process RNA secondary structures, generate embeddings, train models, and perform downstream analysis.

### Input Format
The primary input is typically a CSV or TSV file containing at least one column with RNA secondary structures in dot-bracket notation.

### Running the Scripts (Command-Line Tools)
Once installed, the scripts are available as command-line tools. For example, to generate embeddings:

```sh
ginfinity-embed --input path/to/your/rna_data.csv --output path/to/output_embeddings.tsv --model-path path/to/your/model.pth --id-column your_id_col --structure-column-name rna_structure_col
```

**Arguments and detailed usage instructions for all command-line tools (`ginfinity-embed`, `ginfinity-compute-distances`, `ginfinity-generate-windows`, and `ginfinity-train`) can be found in the dedicated scripts documentation: [`src/ginfinity/scripts/scripts_README.md`](src/ginfinity/scripts/scripts_README.md).**

(Note: The path to `scripts_README.md` will be relative to the cloned repository if you're viewing it locally. If the package is installed, users might need to refer to the repository to view this specific README.)
